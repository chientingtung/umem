# UMEM 1.0.0

## Overview
The Unified Memristor Model (UMEM) is a physics-based Verilog-A compact model that supports simulation of resistive (RRAM), ferroelectric (FERAM/FTJ), and magnetic (MRAM) memory devices under a unified framework. This release includes source code, simulation testbenches, and a technical manual.
