# UMEM: Unified Memristor Model

## Overview
UMEM is a **unified compact model for memristive devices**.  
It currently supports three device classes:
- **RRAM** (Resistive RAM)  
- **FERAM/FTJ** (Ferroelectric RAM / Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction)  
- **STT-MRAM** (Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM)  

UMEM is designed as a **well‑posed memristor model** that complies with the **Compact Model Coalition (CMC) Verilog‑A Model Pythonic Rule Enforcer (VAMPyRE)**.  
It uses continuous formulation and well-defined state dynamic equation.
This ensures numerical robustness, reproducibility, and the capability of doing both DC and transient simulation.  
The model is benchmarked with ngspice-44.2_64.
